# Induction tasks

We invited applications (now closed) for the 2022-10 intake. As in [previous years]()  we have set an `induction task` to explore candidates' experience and skills. 
These tasks are based on our current projects, which are always dynamically changing. This year's reflects our Hackathons in Geneva, New Delhi, and OAWeek.


## purpose of internships

The purpose of these internships, in conjunction with the project manager, is to develop the use of semantic tools for 
enhancing and re-using climate knowledge. We have pioneered several approaches and you are asked to explore their use in this induction task:
* read UN IPCC climate change chapters using JupyterNotebooks
* create semantic dictionaries from the content. Clean and update the content using Wikidata references
* use the dictionaries to annotate chapter/s 
* use pygetpapers to automatically search the recent EuropePMC literature for climate-rich articles


The interns who join us will initially productise this approach and apply it to all the IPCC content (50+ chapters). 
We aim at automated approaches but there is always an element of error and cleaning. The result will be a semantic 
version of the IPCC reports (10,000 pages) and many dictionaries based on the content.  You will create resources to display the tools and their use

After this phase we hope to be joined by other groups. Possible examples
* creation of an IPCC/AR6 knowledge graph which can be queried with modern tools
* adaptation of #semanticClimate technology to other public reports such as IPBES.
* use of the dictionaries on current content such as preprints and theses.

We are looking for interns who are capable of working on modern informatics, in a flexible environment, in teams, 
learning new skills and working with a wide variety of other groups.

## details of tasks


Please complete each of the steps and document your results.

We would like to have your results/documentation by November [insert date]

IPCC WG3 Chapters 02, 07, 08 at [Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/)

Read UN IPCC climate change chapters using Jupyter Notebooks on Chapter2: Using THIS LINK-  Google Colab
Create semantic dictionaries from the content  (e.g. abb.xml) 
Clean and update the content using Wikidata references                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 o  Manually validate the unambiguous Wikidata hits and comment on their correctness

o   Resolve TWO ambiguous hits and comment on why these arose? 

o   Could we write software to avoid this in future?

o   Manually search for TWO unlinked terms and propose Wikidata IDs (or none?)

Use the dictionaries to annotate chapter/s 

Edit Jupyter notebook to do Chapter07- download it from THIS LINK-  Google Colab
Use pygetpapers to automatically search the recent EuropePMC literature for climate-rich articles (petermr/puget papers: a Python version of getpapers (github.com))

Describe (MAX 250 words) what you did and why it's useful
