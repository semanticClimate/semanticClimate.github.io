# #semanticClimate
There is a pressing need to make knowledge about climate available to mitigate the effects of gaseous emissions. The most important resource is the UN’s IPCC reports, published about every five years. In 2021-2022 AR6, with 10,000 pages, was released - . Unfortunatley these are published as a set of PDF files which makes them extremely hard to read by humans or machines, preventing their widespread use. #semanticClimate is a group of young Indian science students who are developing tools and community protocols to make IPCC AR6 semantic.

# Goals
* to convert the IPCC documents from PDF into (a) HTML (b) XML
* extract terms and explore their use and meaning
* link terms to [Wikidata](Wikidata.org) and create AMI-dictionaries
* create new structures for navigation, search, display

# What #SemanticClimate does
We develop tools to liberate knowledge from locked PDFs and host events everybody gets a chance to explore the content in these reports through our tools.
Our [Technical Strategy Page](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/ipcc/ar6/wg3#readme) gives an overview of the tools.
# Upcoming Events
Check out our [Events page](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/events.md) for details about upcoming hackathons we host and other events we are part of.

# How to get involved
We are looking for volunteers/funders to:
- run more events
- develop the code (open an Issue/PR to get started)
- develop the content (start a Discussion thread at https://github.com/petermr/petermr/discussions/)
   - dictionaries
   - semantified chapters
   
# IPCC Reports

 * IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. [Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/)
 * IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. [Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/)
 * IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. [Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/)

## About

semanticClimate is an open research project run by volunteers. semanticClimate practices OpenNotebook Science meaning all activity and material is open. semanticClimate exists to further develop open-source technology for knowledge liberation on the topic of climate change for the benefit humanity, scholarship, and education.
